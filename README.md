# d9-upgrade_status-project

To better prepare for D9 I am rerunning my expertiment of checking everything for readiness.  

See the project setup script for instructions on how I set up my environment.  

Hit me up on drupal (mcdwayne) or midcamp slack (dwaynemcdaniel) for questions and for the needed CSV, which I am coordinating through google sheets.
